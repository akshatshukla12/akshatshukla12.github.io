         MINARE is the annual geo-mining fest of the Department of Mining Engineering.
MINARE 2020 is the 5th edition of this extravagant conclave. MINARE is organised
with the objective of providing the society of mining engineers in the making of a
deeper insight into the subject and its impact on the industry, India being a major
reservoir of natural resources like coal and petroleum. Various technical events,
workshops, guest lectures, fun events, case study presentation solutions and paper
presentation are organised during the course of this mega event. The mining
extravaganza not only has a series of competent exhibition of experience and
knowledge but also has a pinch of cultural fervour to welcome students from across the
length and breadth of the country.</br>
The fest is organised by the Mining Engineering Society with attendees from various
institutes of repute who are eager to deepen their knowledge on cutting edge
technologies. We are keen at surfacing professionals together for both education and
networking.</br>
Like the phoenix, we rise from the ashes and we are planning to take our previous
version which witnessed a participation of 200+ students to greater heights. This
hugely anticipated edition is set to target 300+ students among the elite institutions of
India, which includes IITs, NITs and reputed technical institutes of the country. This
fest is limited to students only, no industry/company can participate in any technical
events, however they may be allowed to hold exhibitions in our premises.</br>

With the vision of having national level students, the Department of Mining
Engineering started MINARE in 2014 to make a typical stage for all the budding
Mining Engineers. The past versions were loaded with psyche beating difficulties,
guest lectures, workshops, technical events and prizes that went for the extension of
musings into the unexplored domains of the field.</p>
